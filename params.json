The command is sophisticated, determining, for instance, whether a tax filer is better off itemizing or claiming the standard deduction. However, `taxsim9` is less useful for more basic calculations such as estimating tax liability and marginal tax rates given taxable income (rather than gross or adjusted gross income with deductions). Because `taxsim9` or — to my knowledge — any other Stata command cannot perform analyses on simple taxable income data, [Kyle Rozema](http://kylerozema.com/) and I wrote `taxliab`.\r\n\r\n###Stata\r\nInstall `taxliab` by opening Stata and running the command:\r\n\r\n`net install taxliab, from(http://kylerozema.com/stata/taxliab)`\r\n\r\nThe documentation for taxliab is included with the installation. To read the documentation, run the command:\r\n\r\n`help taxliab`\r\n\r\n###Matlab\r\n\r\nTo use the Matlab function contained in this repository, place the `taxliab.m` file along with its accompanying dataset `UStaxschedule.mat` into your Matlab working directory and call it in the standard way.\r\n\r\nIt requires three input variables: nominal taxable income, year, and filing status.\r\n\r\nFiling status codes:  <ol>\r\n  <li>Married filing together</li>\r\n  <li>Married filing separately</li>\r\n  <li>Single</li>\r\n  <li>Head of Household</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n###Example\r\nRun the `taxliab_example.m` script to demonstrate examples of how the `taxliab.m` function can be used. The following plot gives an example of the type of data that can be generated by `taxliab`.\r\n\r\n![this plot](https://plot.ly/~hautahi/30.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
